### About me

Hi you :) My name is Cláudia, but most people call me Klauz. I'm a Product Designer based in Portugal, learning how to make things that add value to people's lives.

I've been working here:

* **Codacy** 
  * 2021 — Senior Product Designer
* **DefinedCrowd** 
  * 2020 — UX Design & Research Manager
  * 2019 — UX Design Lead
  * 2016 — UX Designer & UI Developer


### About this blog

Before we dwell on this blog's content, I'd like to explain you the reasoning behind it.

Up until now, career-wise, I've been many things. I started my job as a Designer/UI Developer, moving more and more into a UX / Research position until I had the honor of becoming the Lead and Manager of one of the most incredible UX teams in  Portugal. The problem was that, up until then, the question was always the same: 

> "What do you want to pursue?"
> 
> I had no idea

This year, however, the paradigm changed a bit. 2020 pushed me, as it did to everybody, to a place where I needed to start defining my goals, set my priorities straight, understand what kind of change I wanted to drive throughout the year. And, so for 2021, I set myself four goals:

* **To feel useful** (by adding value to people's lives)
* **To keep learning**
* **To reduce stress** (personal, professional, financial)
* **To be present** (to my family and friends)

This blog is born to support the first goal. Feeling useful. And even though I know I have to keep focused on my goals and the objectives I want to accomplish, the reality is that there are many ways of adding value to people's lives. However, what I need to create are means of doing so while learning, not overloading myself, and being present.

So here I am. **Making Things.** This blog aims to capture some of the insights I'll be gathering from my pursuit of following my goals. You should expect some very weird content and hopefully some know-how around Design, Product, and others. Hope you stick around! :)

Cheers!
