# open design journal
a base for designing / developing out in the open.

With this project I have two main goals:

1 . To build my portfolio in an inclusive and engaging way, having both projects that englobe UX / UI & code.
2 . To have a base for other people to play around and build their own design / code portfolios in a open way.
