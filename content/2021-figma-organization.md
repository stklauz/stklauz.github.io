Anyone who's tried Figma can see how amazing it can be! But how do you keep it tidy, organized and scalable?

Last year, our team made the decision to move all our files from Sketch to Figma. We were a team of 12, with around 250+ sketch files (ðŸ¥²), struggling to keep our files up-to-date between ourselves. Comparing to our previous toolset, from a price standpoint, moving to Figma was a nobrainer. However, because of how many files we had, we couldn't just throw ourselves at the tool at once. We first planned a transition period, to understand what we'd need to do and how we'd need to do it, and within it, right on top stood "how to organize figma".

As we looked at a few approaches of organizing our files in Figma, I remember there wasn't too much information about it. So, hopefully today I can share a little bit of what I learnt (feel free to give me some feedback!).

## Understanding your users

Before anything, it's important you understand who will be using Figma, and what they need. In product organizations, you will most likely have three types of users:

* **Designers & Writers** need to understand the end-to-end flows of your product to create a flow within a specific scope (of a user story or a Jira ticket)
* **Developers** need to understand what to implement within such scope, visually and interactively
* **Product Managers & Stakeholders** need to find items and comment/contribute to your designs

Because of this, it's important to create ways of **Finding**, **Scoping** and **Gathering** information. We'll go through these bit by bit in this post.

To make these three things, you can work with Hierarcy, Libraries, and 

Nonethless, the important part here is that you understand that by organizing Figma you'll designing your team's workflow. So, like any design task, don't forget to prototype, test, iterate and overcommunicate. ðŸ˜‰

## Scoping

#### Layouts vs Deliverables

Teams and Projects are up to you! The most important thing is choosing

Delivery (what devs need) vs Maintenance (what do designers need)

Devs need to know what they have to implement during a specific time frame above all (jira tickets, etc). They may seldom be interested in things that work cross platforms

Designers need to think about flows (jira) but also need to take into consideration what already exists. The flows that intertwine. know all the states that a page already contains, so they can work 

You can have two approaches to this:

- File per Page
  Helps you get context of wtf you're designing. may be better for bigger organizations that start working at a micro levels

- File per Delivery
  Interesting if you assume that you're working on deliverying flows. However, its always good to keep a Flow / Masters file at hand.

You also have the "go-wild" option: have 1 file for the whole product. Honestly, if your product is short, sweet and simple, go for it! You can create prototypes and have evrythign connected nice and neatly in a single place.


#### File anatomy

**What do you need in a file?**

Well, everything you may need really.
prototypes, sandbox, archives, research, areas, covers, emojis... lol there's so much information on this already.

I think the most interesting topic here is trully versioning. After all, this is a big part of Figma. You can create files that are "always up to date" or organize them by iterations that you deliver.

A heads up here, this year figma is working on a new Feature that will introduce BRanching, and it seems like it will be possible to "share branches" as deliverabled to your developers. If so, that solves a lot of the problems of having to duplicate materials / detach components to break them between versions.

Tip: create a file template that everybody can duplicate and use. Another useful thing is creating a "File Library" where you have all structures in one place, like covers, deliverable containers, and any other elements that will make your files look consistent all accross the org! :)

#### Creating a hiearcy

Now that we

In Figma you'll be working with 5 possible levels of information:

Teams -> Projects -> Files -> Pages -> Frames

## Keeping things up-to-date

Components, you have a UI Kit. Cool. To keep things up to date, I encourage creating Layouts.
Don't exagerate on the libraries, you might fall on the trap of not finding anything lol.
