*Sometimes, it seems like your top-level managers are making very weird decisions about your company and its future. You would pitch in and give some ideas, but you don't know that much about running a business. That's great! What you need to do is to start learning the fundamentals. This article won't solve your problem, but hopefully, it will shed some light around basic business concepts.*

To understand the decisions and path your company is taking, you should first understand its context, internally and externally. What I mean by this, is start asking yourself questions around what is your company's context, what are its competitive advantages and even eventually, start looking at its and market's vulnerabilities.

To get you started, we'll look at the company's external and internal contexts, by going over two very similar concepts: Industry and Business lifecycles.

Industry and Business lifecycles describe the typical trajectory that both an industry and a company follow. Although they seem quite similar, there are two important things to keep in mind:

* **They are independent** — even if an industry is in a Mature state, that doesn't mean your company will be too. And this example applies to every stage of these lifecycles: there can be Mature companies entering New Industries, the same way that there can be Seed companies in Declining industries.

* **And they move at different speeds** — and this applies both to the relationship between Industry and Company, and to the relationships between different industries and different companies.  A few examples of this are when we compare the Agricultural and the Phone industry we compare an industry with thousands of years against an industry that is less than a century old. Another example is Blackberry, a company that left a Growing industry.
