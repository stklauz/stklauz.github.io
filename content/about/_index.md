## About me

Hi you :) My name is Cl√°udia, but most people call me Klauz. I'm a Product Designer based in Portugal, learning how to make things bring people value.

I'm currently working at [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/sd) as a Product Designer for [Pulse](https://www.pulse.codacy.com/), and before that I was working at [Defined.ai](https://www.defined.ai/) as a Designer & Design Manager.

**About this blog** *updated: jan 2022*

Well, this blog is just a place for me to write. It was meant to focus on Product and Design, but I also like to write about other things, like personal finance, mental health and random projects. The main goal right now is to keep writing a fun process!

If you'd like to reach out, feel free to send me a message on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/claudiacvlho/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/claudiacvlho)!
